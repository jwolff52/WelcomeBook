WelcomeBook

=========

"book_title" is the title of the book.

"book_author" is the author of the book.

You can have as many messages as you would like.

If you would like to use color-codes use the '&' symbol followed by 0-9 and a-f. For more information on 
color-codes visit, http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Formatting_codes.

If you use a color-code ensure that everything after the "p1", "l1", "book_title", "book_author" is surrounded by single-quotes (' ').

To add a page to the book start a line with p1: then the text for the page.

To add a line of lore to the book start a line with l1: then what should go on that line. Lore is the
description that pops up when you mouse over the item with your cursor

EXAMPLE:

INCORRECT:

p1: This &1is &fa test of &6the color-codes

CORRECT:

p1: 'This &1is &fa test of &6the color-codes'
